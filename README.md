# Javascript Machine Learning - Self-Driving Car

Currently a fun learning project that I am doing on the side to familiarise myself with Javascript. 

This project is designed to not use any libraries. At this stage, the program marks my learning progress. It has yet to become more personalized.

Learning resources are from FreeCodeCamp.
